GitHubViewer is a mobile app built with JavaScript technologies based in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). It is amazing app for search and view details and repositoris of the GitHub users. It used the GitHub public api for consults.

## Flux Architeture

For administrate and share the main state to all application, we use the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) library.

The **Redux** is a state management library that follows the principles of [Flux Architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/).

But, the Redux follow the three principles:

- Single source of truth
- State is read-only
- Changes are made with pure functions
